By default, the makefile with the name "makefile" is used by the make program.
So, to build the project with the first makefile, simply use the command:

make

This will use the makefile to build the project from scratch.
From this point you can boot up rmiregistry (in this example I'm using port 7474) and then
run the following make command to run the server:

make run-server

Or, you can run this make command to run the client application:

make run-client

If you want to remove all of your class files, use:

make clean

If you want, you can also fashion your makefiles the way "easymakefile" is set up.
It is less efficient, in that, it will rebuild the whole project from scratch every time 
you want to build it. However, as you can see, it's much easier to write/adapt. If
you want to test out this makefile on this example, use the -f argument to specify it
as the makefile:

make -f easymakefile
make -f easymakefile run-server
make -f easymakefile run-client
make -f easymakefile clean
